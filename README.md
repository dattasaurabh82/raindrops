Simple scene of raindrops falling in a pond. Using [VST](https://github.com/osresearch/vst) and its Processing library by [@osresearch](https://github.com/osresearch) and [@jacobjoaquin](https://github.com/jacobjoaquin).

Notes:
- Lots of magic numbers to remove (move into XML, or YAML if Java can parse it)
- Define a timestep so frame rate doesn't affect animation speed
